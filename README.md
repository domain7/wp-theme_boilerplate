# WordPress boilerplate theme

A boilerplate theme for WordPress with an emphasis on simplicity and reuse. By default, all pages except the homepage are rendered with archive.php. Use front-page.php for your homepage, then you can use index.php for everything else. If it gets weird, refer to [The Flowchart Of Template Witchcraft and Wizardry](http://codex.wordpress.org/File:wp-template-hierarchy.jpg) to determine which template file to add.

Less is more. Only create as many custom templates as you need. Think modularly.

This is most definitely a work in progress and opportunities for improvement exist. Feel free to make pull requests.
